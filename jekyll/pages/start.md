Learning DGL
---
The [DGL at a glance](https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/basics/1_first.html) is
the most common place to get started with.  Each tutorial is accompanied with a
runnable python script and jupyter notebook that can be downloaded.

The best way to learn DGL is with model examples. Our model tutorials are
categorized based on the way they utilize DGL APIs.

* [Graph Neural Network and its
  variant](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/models/index.html#tutorials1-index):
Learn how to use DGL to train popular GNN models on one input graph.
* [Dealing with many small
  graphs](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/models/index.html#tutorials2-index):
Learn how to batch many graph samples for max efficiency.
* [Generative
  models](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/models/index.html#tutorials3-index):
Learn how to deal with dynamically-changing graphs.
* [Old (new) wines in new
  bottle](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/models/index.html#tutorials4-index):
Learn how to combine DGL with tensor-based DGL framework in a flexible way.
Explore new perspective on traditional models by graphs.
* [Training on giant
  graphs](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/models/index.html#tutorials5-index):
Learn how to train graph neural networks on giant graphs.
